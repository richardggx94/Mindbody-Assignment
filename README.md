# Mindbody-Assignment-Richard Goh
Background 
1. This repository documents the code and statistical results from calculations pertaining to the Mindbody case study 
2. Most of the calculations and models are done in Python on Google Colab given the technical requirements which Excel cannot support 
3. Selected results that inform the analysis in the final presentation PDF are pasted in Excel for easy access 

Project Structure
1. Mindbody_Assignment.ipynb: This is the main file for review. It is a Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including all code, commentary, and outputs from the various analyses performed
2. Sr_Analyst_Pricing_Take_Home_-_Candidate_Copy_(1).xlsx: The raw data file used in the analysis.
   
Viewing the Analysis (Recommended)

The easiest way to review this project is to view the Mindbody_Assignment.ipynb file directly on GitHub. GitHub has a built-in viewer that will render the notebook with all the code, text, and outputs in a clear, readable format.

Running the Code (Optional)

Click on the Google Colab link in the main project file. Attached Excel file needs to be uploaded on Google Colab when testing the code in Colab as the file gets deleted after every run session [Sr_Analyst_Pricing_Take_Home_-_Candidate_Copy_(1).xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21468496/Sr_Analyst_Pricing_Take_Home_-_Candidate_Copy_.1.xlsx)
