# Mindbody-Assignment-Richard Goh
Background 
1. This repository documents the code and statistical results from calculations pertaining to the Mindbody case study. 
2. Most of the calculations and models are done in Python given the technical requirements which Excel cannot support. 
3. Selected results that inform the analysis in the final presentation PDF are pasted in Excel for easy access.
